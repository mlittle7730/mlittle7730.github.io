Description : Python Gov Bid Sorting Application

Intent      : This project was converted to a Python application as to
              demonstrate a complex language conversion and implement
              a GUI that was more visually appealing than terminal.
              This artifact will import bids from a CSV file, where
              you can then sort the data by different parameters.
              The application will also allow the user to add a bid,
              and the added bids will be uploaded to the database.
