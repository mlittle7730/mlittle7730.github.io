### *Code Review*

Why conduct Code Review anyway?
Whether the project is large scale or a small project, code review should be a prioritized process. The objective of a successful code review is reviewing it and making sure it is functional, doesn't have any logic errors or bugs within the code, making sure it is organized and practically written, and lastly verifying its security.

Here I review the code I enhanced. I go over the functionality of the original code, how the structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting can be improved, and lastly a walkthrough of the planned enhancements and how they will meet the five course outcomes accross the three categories.

### *Software Design and Engineering*

My artifact for the software design and engineering category is a C++ project that was converted into a Python application that uploads data from a .csv file and sorts it using several parameters. This application also allows the user to import new data to display and sort.
