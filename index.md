### *Code Review*

Why conduct Code Review anyway?
Whether the project is large scale or a small project, code review should be a prioritized process. The objective of a successful code review is reviewing it and making sure it is functional, doesn't have any logic errors or bugs within the code, making sure it is organized and practically written, and lastly verifying its security.

Here I review the code I enhanced. I go over the functionality of the original code, how the structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting can be improved, and lastly a walkthrough of the planned enhancements and how they will meet the five course outcomes accross the three categories.

## <center>ORIGINAL ARTIFACT</center>

This is the artifact project I will be making enhancements to. This application is written in C++ and it has a basic terminal interface for users to display bids and sort them using basic sort algorithms. The reason I chose this project as an artifact to enhance is because it has a lot of room for improvement such as a creating a proper GUI, making the code modular, better algorithm utilization such as sorting by parameters, and enhancing the user experience and usability such as creating an "Add a bid" function and a database to store the added bids.

Here is the original terminal interface for the application:

## <center>ENHANCED ARTIFACT</center>

This is my Python Application after all of the changes have been made to meet all of the three categories. The GUI is visually appealing and the application functions allow the user to display the bids, sort them by a few different parameters, add a bid entry, and to display the bids that have been uploaded to the database.

Here is the new and improved GUI for this application:

### *Software Design and Engineering*

I enhanced the Software Design and Engineering in this artifact by converting it from a C++ project to a Python application. This application loads bid data from a CSV file and uses sorting algorithms to sort those bids by different parameters. When it was a C++ project the program would launch in a terminal window that was not visually pleasing, so it has been updated to a nicer GUI that now has radio select buttons and displays the data in an organized column using tkinter.
