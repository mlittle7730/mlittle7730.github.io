### <center>Final Project</center>

*Note: Due to Libary version, "append" on line 78 of the "data.py" file may have to be updated to "_append" or vise versa.*

## Functionality

Originally, this code was a [C++ Project](https://github.com/mlittle7730/mlittle7730.github.io/tree/Vector-Sorting) that has now been updated to a Python Application. This project allows the user to view data off of a CSV file, sort the data using different parameters using sorting alorithms, and upload new bids/data to a database through SQL Lite. All of this was implemented through a visually pleasing GUI using tkinter and done with security practices in mind.
